            The Tambaqui, scientifically known as <em>Colossoma macropomum</em>, 
            is a fascinating and vital fish species native to the Amazon River basin in South America. 
            Renowned for its size, taste, and ecological significance, the Tambaqui plays an essential role 
            in both the ecosystem and the livelihoods of many local communities.

        <h2>Habitat and Distribution</h2>
        <p>
        The Tambaqui is primarily found in the <u>Amazon and Orinoco River basins</u>, which span several countries including Brazil, Peru, Colombia, and Venezuela. These vast river systems provide the ideal environment for the Tambaqui, characterized by warm, freshwater rivers, flooded forests, and diverse aquatic ecosystems.

        <p>
            During the rainy season, these rivers overflow, creating extensive floodplains where Tambaqui thrive. They are particularly well adapted to these fluctuating water levels, using the flooded forests for feeding and breeding.
